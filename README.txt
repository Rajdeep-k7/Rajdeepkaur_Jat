## My Portfolio: Built with the Bold & Blocky Hyperspace Template

I'm excited to launch my portfolio website, built using the eye-catching Hyperspace template by HTML5 UP (@ajlkn). 

This template perfectly captures the style I was going for:

* **Fun and Blocky:** The design features a playful, geometric aesthetic with a focus on bold shapes and vibrant colors. It's sure to grab attention and showcase my work in a unique way.
* **Animated Touches:** Subtle animations add a touch of dynamism to the page, making the user experience even more engaging.
* **One-Page Layout (with Bonus!):** While Hyperspace excels as a single-page portfolio, it also offers a versatile "generic" page template. This flexibility allows me to potentially create dedicated pages for specific projects or additional information if needed.

I've been itching to share my work for a while, and thanks to the Hyperspace template, I finally have a platform that reflects my creativity and personality. 

**Behind the Scenes:**

Hyperspace is built with free and open-source tools, making it a great choice for anyone starting a portfolio. Here's a shoutout to the incredible resources used:

* **Template:** Hyperspace by HTML5 UP (html5up.net) - Huge thanks to AJ (@ajlkn) for creating this fantastic template!
* **Images:** Unsplash (unsplash.com) - This platform is a goldmine for beautiful, public domain images that elevate any website.
* **Icons:** Font Awesome (fontawesome.io) - A comprehensive library of icons that add visual interest and clarity to web pages.
* **JavaScript Libraries:**
    * jQuery (jquery.com) - A foundational library for building interactive web experiences.
    * Scrollex ([github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex](https://github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex)) - This custom library by AJ likely adds scroll-triggered animations to the template.
    * Responsive Tools ([github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools](https://github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools)) - Another custom library by AJ, probably used to ensure the website adapts perfectly to different screen sizes.

**So, dive in and explore!** I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio as much as I enjoyed building it.
